The start page is the first link in the sidebar and always server under `/`. You can adjust the content by creating an `index.md` in the root of the project.

```markdown
<!-- /index.md -->

These are my notes.
```

You can render a list of your notes on the start page by using the [[Dynamic Content]] features.
