You can build and deploy your notes using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub. Add your workflow file `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml` and push it to your remote `main` branch.

## gh-pages

Add the following to `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml` to enable deployment to GitHub pages.

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages (npm)

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

  ELEVENTY_NOTES_PATH_PREFIX: "eleventy-notes"
