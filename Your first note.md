Now that the template is ready, you can create your first note. Go ahead and create a new file `My Note.md` in the root of the project.

```markdown
<!-- /My Note.md -->

# Hello World

This is **my first** note ðŸŽ‰
```

You should now see the note in the sidebar. Click on it to open it and see the rendered content.
